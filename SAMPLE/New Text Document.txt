Simple Modular  Project is ready for further demonstration and build. 

Step 1. create at least two directories , 

Step 2. npm init in each directory to be imported
  - each module should be labeled in the package.json file with the proper type 
or with the .mjs  extension as opposed to just   ".js" 
- the preferred method is by each directories package module

each directory should have a seperate npm init  

in each , under the description of the package.json file , 
for modules only , you may add a 
"type":"module"   as is , to make the js file modular.  

Step 3. Write import and export functions properly. 

Step 4 . use npm link on each page to add them into npm link. 

then , you may use the command , inside the app or main import directory , out of the latter , 
and run in the terminal

 npm link $DIRNAME?$ $DIRNAME?$      

 where $DIRNAME?$ is used for the directory name with or without the extension. 

Step 3. , you should now see your project INSIDE the node modules folder. 
this is now a confirmation that the files are linked. 
and , as long as using a es6 module or common js module , 
you may import and export both values and functions in code .
